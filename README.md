Matariki is the MƒÅori name of the Pleides star cluster. The predawn rising of Matariki in the mid-winter sky marks the changing of the seasons and the beginning of the Maori New Year.

Using NASA's JPL Horizons API, we have programmed a user-friendly python script that outputs the date of the public holiday with any reasonable year as input. As well as being a submission for our school Hackathon, we believe this script would have practical use for any families
